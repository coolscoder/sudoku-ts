## Project

Building a functional and working sudoku to practice TypeScript in combination with React!

---

## Project Status

Project is: _It works!_ :heavy_check_mark:

---

## Learnings

Mostly the logic and Redux part, it seemed daunting at first. Been learning a lot about it. I've had massive help from Barry Michael Doyle on this. :nerd_face:

---

## Setup

install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../sudoku
$ npm install
$ npm start

```
